# OOP-PROJECT-PIZZA-SHOP-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

1. Introduction:
   
The project aims to develop a Pizza Shop Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. This system will streamline the operations of a pizza shop, including order management, inventory tracking, customer management, and billing.

3. Features:

Order Management: Allow customers to place orders for pizzas with custom toppings and sizes.

Inventory Management: Keep track of ingredients, toppings, and other supplies to ensure smooth operations.

Customer Management: Maintain a database of customer information, including contact details and order history.

Billing: Calculate the total cost of orders, including taxes and discounts.

Menu Management: Easily update and manage the list of available pizzas and their prices.

Delivery Management: If applicable, manage delivery logistics, including tracking orders and assigning delivery personnel.

3. Class Structure:

Pizza: Represents a pizza with properties such as size, toppings, and price.

Order: Contains information about a customerâ€™s order, including the list of pizzas and total cost.

Inventory: Manages the stock of ingredients and supplies.

Customer: Stores customer information and order history.

Billing: Calculates the total cost of orders.

Menu: Handles the menu items and their prices.

Delivery: Manages delivery-related tasks.

4. Implementation:

Utilize OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create modular and reusable code.

Implement user-friendly interfaces for placing orders, updating menus, and managing inventory.

Ensure data integrity and security by validating user inputs and implementing proper error handling mechanisms.

5. Testing:

Conduct thorough testing of each module to ensure functionality and reliability.

Perform integration testing to verify interactions between different modules.

Gather feedback from potential users to identify any issues or areas for improvement.

6. Deployment:

Deploy the Pizza Shop Management System on appropriate hardware and software platforms.

Provide documentation and user manuals to guide users through system usage and maintenance.

7. Maintenance and Support:

Offer ongoing maintenance and support services to address any issues and incorporate new features as needed.

Provide training to staff members on using the system effectively.

8. Conclusion:
The Pizza Shop Management System will automate and streamline various tasks involved in running a pizza shop, leading to increased efficiency and customer satisfaction. By leveraging OOP principles in C++, the system will be scalable, maintainable, and robust, catering to the needs of pizza shop owners and customers alike.
